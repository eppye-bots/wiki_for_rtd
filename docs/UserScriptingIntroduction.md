## User Scripting 

Bots has many places (exit points) where user scripting can be used. These user scripts are optional; bots will work without them but they provide great control over functionality for advanced users.

-	Channels can have a [communicationscript](ChannelsScripting.md)
-	Routes can have a [routescript](RoutesScripts.md)
-	Bots-engine can also have [it's own routescript](RouteScriptsExampleBotsEngine.md)
-	Enveloping can be modified with an [envelopescript](EnvelopeScripting.md)
-	etc
